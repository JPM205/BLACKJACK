# BLACKJACK
This C++ program simulates a simplified version of the classic casino card game, Blackjack. Developed by Jesse Martinez, this console-based application allows users to play Blackjack against a computerized dealer. The program incorporates fundamental Blackjack rules, including card dealing, player decisions (hit or stand), and determining the winner based on hand values. It also includes a basic heuristic to estimate winning probabilities for the player.

The program is structured using object-oriented principles, defining classes for Card, Deck, Hand, and BlackjackGame. It follows the standard flow of a Blackjack game, starting with the initial deal, allowing the player to hit or stand, simulating the dealer's turn, and finally determining the winner. The random shuffling of the deck and the simplicity of the winning probability heuristic make this a beginner-friendly implementation.
